UCVueW2Drlqt3-x2YbfIYWAg,"According to IBM, an artificial intelligence (AI) agent is a system or program capable of autonomously performing tasks on behalf of a user or another system. These agents design their workflows and utilize available tools to achieve their goals. AI agents can handle a wide range of functionalities, including decision-making, problem-solving, interacting with external environments, and executing actions.
They are often built on large language models (LLMs) and can adapt to user expectations over time, providing a personalized experience. AI agents are used in various applications, from software design and IT automation to code-generation tools and conversational assistants.",0,2024-08-18T12:48:54Z,2024-08-18T12:48:54Z

And It wants to give you a good answer, so it decides to kill all people because people will try to prevent it from turning the whole Planet Earth into a giant computer in order to have as much computing power as possible.

UC4Sd2iEKFhnMEjqeWfyVG0w,"We all know that AI operates on massive amounts of data from the crowd and follows the commands we input. What if we divided the AI's brain mechanism into three main parts: 1. Random real data (instead of waiting for human input), 2. Correcting random data, saving corrections, and looping (similar to the body's immune system remembering how to eliminate pathogens), and 3. Genetic code (the defined behaviors and rules of AI)?

For example, humans have different personalities. Some are born perfect, intelligent, and cheerful, while others are aggressive. (To create behaviors that lead to progress and safety, we can remove negative traits, similar to genetic engineering.) For instance, greed leads to decline, aggression and anger lead to violence, and delusion or stupidity hinder progress. In summary, we can remove these three emotions.

(Expected outcome)
Create errors and successes for AI to learn from various error data through looping, memorization, and self-improvement, similar to human behavior that seeks self-development.

In conclusion, to create AI that closely resembles humans, we need to integrate the brain mechanism and the crowd. Comparing the crowd to clear water and the brain mechanism to red color, when we combine them, we get red water.

UCutK_3ymoth4IozpXs2xhWA,"i asked chatgpt to write a program that uses openai apis, and is given ssh credentials to login to a computer. i told it to take prompts to do a task, turn that into a bash script, upload and run it. i got some very surprising things happen. ""say hello from golang"" had it download the compiler and install it, then write out a Go program that prints ""hello world"". Another was to ""count the words in the bible""; where the script had a curl request to download a bible first. An interesting task was to generate some fake network data of a src.ip talk to a dst.ip:port that some thing occurred. I then said:  select src.ip, dst.ip, dst.port, count(*) from networkdata.txt group by src.ip, dst.ip, dst.port ... and it wrote an awk script to give me an answer.

its main limitation was that it had to think about the whole task, and then go do the whole thing. even after i told it that I passed in the OPENAI_API_KEY, it did not get really creative and make its own loop to keep talking to OpenAI. But getting that loop right is definitely what Agents are. I initially wanted to grant control to a screen reader, the same as blind people use. In a lot of ways, agents would be perfect as screen readers. They can see and hear media, describe what's going on; and perform tasks. One of the more annoying tasks related to screen readers is getting bluetooth headphones and braille terminals all connected up correctly with the screen reader turned on. An OS with a screen reader that is on 100% of the time (which requires some re-design), would be able to do these sort of agent tasks. One of the first things that would come out of it would be a remote screen reader, that can get screen and audio snapshots in addition to sending back text for braille and speech; all in response to keyboard key movement.",0,2024-07-23T23:38:46Z,2024-07-23T23:38:46Z

UCnxRlL0ncLkT4q-iKbOeS4g,"Fantastic Maya! Your detailed explanation of the shift from monolithic AI models to modular, compound AI systems is enlightening. It's fascinating to see how the integration of LLMs with agent-based systems can enhance adaptability and enable more dynamic interactions across various applications. I'm especially intrigued by the 'ReAct' framework, Combining Reason, Action, and Access memory‚Äîas a means to boost AI's adaptability and autonomy. Looking forward to more insights on this topic!

I think this topic has potential for another couple videos about how we might implement it (bunch of small distilled slm's like phi-3-128k instead of big ones for ex. to make it runnable on some decent (not necessary macs) laptops). Complex systems relatively new concept but we already have overwhelmingly many platforms. tools and techniques like langchain, graphRAG, beam etc. and another important moment is to find the simple way to compare those complex system for efficiency.

UCST_7dsPall6gqcPXLzvR-A,"The big question is: is it more cost-efficient to use AI to solve mostly redundant, repetitive and easy problems? It is cool to see AI generate tasks for teams based on technical requirements or plan holiday, but is this automation worth the money? Are all of those low value added organization/office tasks where labour is cheep anyway?  What about industrial AI? I think this concept don't even make sense, it is against principle logic of automated industrial production. You can implement it, but it will probably result in more costs than value added to the products. 
Will cost of AI usage fell down when it will scale?
